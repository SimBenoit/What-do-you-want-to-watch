Point of the project is to make a "what do you want to watch" engine for when my girlfriend asks me what i want to watch.

Idea is to pull data from websites where its available about movies and shows (IMBD API, etc) and store the data locally (names, imagess, directors, main actors, streaming website, etc etc) and be able to click on what is considered *to watch* and what is considered *cozy*  for example.

Main attraction is the roulette of "what do you want to watch" to set parameters of movies and spin the wheel of what to watch and sort through local DB of movies that have been watched, etc, etc.
